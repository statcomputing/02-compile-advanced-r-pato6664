\section{\underline{Problems}}

\begin{itemize}
  \item When compiling the book several packages were not yet installed - as we run the compilation, R will give an error message stating which libraries are missing which we can then install from eith CRAN or GitHub and then re-run the process. 
  \item Needed to update R and re-install rtools for the most recent version - can be done via 'installr' library and looking up rtools installation online
  \item Needed to make sure RStudio recognizes the updated version of rtools - look up online how to do this. 
\end{itemize}
